## üîß Major Issues Resolved

### 1. Hero Image Loading Problems
**Problem:** Hero image wouldn't display on ryanmckenzie.com despite multiple attempts
**Root Cause:** Railway deployment was corrupting static image files during transmission
**Solution:** Switched to external GitHub CDN hosting with simplified CSS approach

**Key Changes:**
- Used `background-image` CSS property instead of React Image components
- Hosted image via GitHub raw content: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RyeMcKenzie81/ryanmckenzie-site/main/hero-backup.jpg`
- Added preload link in layout for faster loading
- Fixed responsive positioning for mobile vs desktop

### 2. Hero Text Positioning & Styling
**Problem:** Text overlapped with person in image and lacked contrast
**Solution:** Implemented responsive positioning with enhanced styling

**Changes:**
- Mobile: Centered text with `w-80` (320px) width
- Desktop: Left-positioned text with `max-w-2xl lg:max-w-3xl` width
- Added semi-transparent background (`bg-black/40`) with backdrop blur
- Enhanced text shadows for better readability
